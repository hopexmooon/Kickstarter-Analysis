# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
    * The purpose of the analysis is to compare different campaigns launch dates and funding goals. We had to use graphs, pivot tables, and various formulas to compare failed, successful, and canceled theater/plays. We are trying to find similarities or patterns and determine if a campaigns launch date had an influence on reaching their funding goals.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
        * Analyzing theater outcomes based on the launch date throughout the year can be shown on the line chart below. We can clearly see that the highest percentage of successful plays had a launch date in May. We see that the first few months of the year see a sharp incline until May, which it then takes a dramatic decline. October has a small increase but by December the rate of successful outcomes and failed outcomes almost crossover - meaning that for every successful play there is a failed play that was launched in the same month. Canceled plays seem to be consistent throughout the year with only a small decline in July and October. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
        * When comparing the status of a launch (successful, canceled, or failed) to the budget goal we see the highest number of successful plays with a fundraiser goal of $1000-4999. From the line graph below we see that with a higher budget the outcome only gets worse. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
        * One of the biggest challenges for this assignment was the fact that deliverable 2 - creating an outcome based on goals did not look like the example. I double checked my formulas when using the COUNTIFS formula but couldn’t figure out why my line graph didn’t look like the example. I re-downloaded the excel sheet and tried it again and came up with the same problem. I based my analysis above using the data I gathered - even if it was incorrect. In the future I’ll attend tutoring sessions before submitting. 

## Results
From the outcomes based on launch date I concluded that the lowest rate of successful plays are launched at the second half of the year. Between March and May is the best time to launch a play - because the success rate is at its highest. After May we see a sharp decline in successful plays.  Another analysis is that successful and failed plays both see an increase during October. October has an increase in plays compared to September. One conclusion I can draw from outcomes based on goals is that a higher fundraiser goal doesn’t mean the play will have a higher level of success. One limitation on this dataset is the lack of data for canceled plays when analyzing outcome based on goals, as well as a lacking of data for half of the failed plays. One improvement for analyzing the Launch date would be to use a bar graph. Using a bar graph would be helpful to compared successful, canceled, and failed plays side by side instead of reading them independently on the line chart.
